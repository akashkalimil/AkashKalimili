                                        <p>I worked with 6800 series Motorola Microprocessor and learned microprocessor architecture. I also designed and programmed the processor in assembly for a specific function. Other components of this project include ROMs, Counters, Logic Gates. During Advanced Audio Electronics course, used previous microprocessor circuit for DSP. Later on, I also worked with a gate array for DSP. The image below is a schematic, I designed, of the original processor circuit w/o any additional components which I have later created to act as supplements for the original design.</p>

                                            <p>In Advanced Analog Electronics, I worked with operational amplifiers, transistors, and RC filters to design a decent quality audio amplifier. I then worked with PSpice and Circuit Lab to design a circuit that modulates multiple signals with one signal path and respectively demodulates them. Using configurations such as diode detectors, I developed AM modulation and demodulation circuits.</p>
                                            
                                            
                                            <p>In Advanced Digital Electronics, I worked with inverters, and gates, or gates, nor gates to design an application with a multiplexed led display. I designed with up/down counters, decoders, and jfet transistors. I also used ROMs for my application and I had a rom for music storage. I developed with DACs for a source of audio.</p>
                                            
                                            
                                            <p>In Advanced Audio Electronics, I worked with ADCs and DACs for DSP of an analog signal. At first I was working with discrete circuitry, but then I started working with FPGAs and CPLDs for the DSP component of the circuit. I also studied discrete fourier transform during the course.</p>

                                        <p>I have three years of experience with Arduino IDE. I have worked with a diverse amount of Arduino boards and shields. Projects include robotic projects such as motor and servo control of an RC vehicle. I have used rf shields and I also have experience programming with the UART on the breakout boards. I used an Arduino to program bluetooth protocols (spread frequency hopping). I have developed many sensor based algorithms for sensors such as ultrasonic, flex, photoresistor, temperature and etc. Last but not least I have experience interfacing relays with microcontrollers. All of my circuit designs and schematics were done with Cadsoft Eagle.</p>

                                        <p>I have two years of experence with CAD. Many of projects of with the Makerbot Replicator 3D printers. I have designed most of my projects in Autodesk Inventor, however some of my projects were done with SolidWorks. My laser printer projects were constructed and designed using Inventor and Solidworks. While any PCB projects were designed with Cadsoft Eagle. A sample of my schematics can be seen in the electronics section of my portfolio</p>

                                        <p>I created a prosthetic hand using servo motors for rotation, and flex sensors as an input. An Arduino microcontroller was used for implementing an algorithm to mimic the motion of the hand. The following link is a video of the device, when the prosthetic hand was at a rudimentary stage. Later on, I rebuilt the prosthetic hand and added wireless communication to demonstrate the implementation of a wireless headset for a disabled patient. The following video shows this wireless arm. The project was showcased at the USA Science and Engineering Festival, Malaria Fair, TJHSST Open House, and Techstravaganza. Bluetooth was later incorporated to provide wireless capability. A raw video of the project can be viewed<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BYWQa4xuSk"> here</a>.</p>

                                            <p>Another project that I worked on was a motorized ultrasonic sensor that had 360 degree field of view. A video of the project can be seen here. As you can see, button presses were correlated to the motion of the ultrasonic sensor. The project was using an arduino microcontroller. Another program for this contraption made the sensor rotate while tracking data. This allowed for numerous applications such as motion tracking of an moving object.

                                            <p>I was also on my high school Senior Botball Robotic's team for two years. Botball is a competition where you design two robots to compete certain tasks with high precision. My responsibilites included coding the robots, in C, and designing/constructing the robot. Sensors can vary from touch sensors to cameras. Was awarded with 4th place in the State (2014) and Judge's Choice for best Overall Design (2015).</p>

                                        <p>I have two years of experience using mixed signal oscilloscopes to trouble shoot circuits. I have a wide variety of experience with circuitry analysis with oscilloscopes ranging from analog modulation circuits to serialization circuits. During highschool, I have expereience with a scope that had a spectrum analysis feature. This allowed me to do projects and FFT analysis. But I also analyzed analog signals when I was engineering modulation circuitry. I have experience with analog sine generators and digital square wave generators as well. They have had many roles in my projects such as an input source or a sample rate. I have been working in an electronics lab for 3 years of highshcool and I have experience using power supplies with my experiments and circuits.</p>
