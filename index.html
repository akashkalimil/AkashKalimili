My higschool provided me with a numerous amount of oppurtunities where I could innovate and learn. I recieved an A ( 92.5% or above) in every electronics and robotics course I took. I partook in the Senior MicroElectronics Research Lab during my senior year of highschool. This experience allowed me to brainstorm and design a project that I could create with the available resources. My goal to make a difference in society drives me to create and innovate. That is why I am really passionate about hardware design.</p>

An example of my effort is when I volunteered as a mentor for the Green Briar West Elementary School Math Team, where I taught competitive mathematics. The reason I decided to contribute to this program is because I didn't have an older peer to teach me competitive math, and I felt that my experience would set an example for peers to spread knowledge in their communities. Precious experiences, like these, allow me to bond with younger peers and help them in any way I could while spreading my passion.</p>

After building ADC circuitry and Serialization Circuitry, I ran many diagnostic tests for baud rate and data loss with oscilloscopes to make sure I wasn't over sampling or undersampling. I used an RN-41 Bluetooth module. I used a microcontroller (Ardiuno) to program program protocols on the flash memory of the chip. On the recieving end of the connection, an FPGA (Nexys 5) was hooked up to the reciever. Using Xilinx , I implemented integration algorithms that I created. My solution for integration drift was numerous trials to calculate constants. At the end of the year, I presented this project at the annual TJStar Convention (Large event where research projects are presented to the school community.

An Arduino microcontroller was used for implementing an algorithm to mimic the motion of the hand. The following link is a video of the device, when the prosthetic hand was at a rudimentary stage. Later on, I rebuilt the prosthetic hand and added wireless communication to demonstrate the implementation of a wireless headset for a disabled patient. The following video shows this wireless arm. The project was showcased at the USA Science and Engineering Festival, Malaria Fair, TJHSST Open House, and Techstravaganza. Bluetooth was later incorporated to provide wireless capability.

A video of the project can be seen here. As you can see, button presses were correlated to the motion of the ultrasonic sensor. The project was using an arduino microcontroller. Another program for this contraption made the sensor rotate while tracking data. This allowed for numerous applications such as motion tracking of an moving object.

Botball is a competition where you design two robots to compete certain tasks with high precision. My responsibilites included coding the robots, in C, and designing/constructing the robot. Sensors can vary from touch sensors to cameras. Was awarded with 4th place in the State (2014) and Judge's Choice for best Overall Design (2015).</p>

But I also analyzed analog signals when I was engineering modulation circuitry. I have experience with analog sine generators and digital square wave generators as well.
