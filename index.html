<p> I am an avid innovator attending <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> for Electrical Engineering Co-op, with diverse experience with electrical systems. With a strong mathematics background and a love to learn and build, I've created things from a bluetooth prosthetic hand, to a wireless inertial navigation system. I am experienced with a diverse amount of software ranging from Solidworks to Python. Holding a strong passion for creation, I love applying my skills and knowledge to design, develop, and tinker revolutionary ideas.

</p>

                                <p>I graduated from <strong>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</strong>, located in Alexandria, Virginia, USA. My higschool provided me with a numerous amount of oppurtunities where I could innovate and learn. I recieved an A ( 92.5% or above) in every electronics and robotics course I took. I partook in the Senior MicroElectronics Research Lab during my senior year of highschool. This experience allowed me to brainstorm and design a project that I could create with the available resources. My goal to make a difference in society drives me to create and innovate.</p>

                                <p>I was very lucky to attend a prestigious STEM high school, and in an effort to give back, I have shared my experiences with others in my greater community. I love helping others and that is why I try to volunteer as much as possible. An example of my effort is when I volunteered as a mentor for the Green Briar West Elementary School Math Team, where I taught competitive mathematics. The reason I decided to contribute to this program is because I didn't have an older peer to teach me competitive math, and I felt that my experience would set an example for peers to spread knowledge in their communities. Precious experiences, like these, allow me to bond with younger peers and help them in any way I could while spreading my passion.</p>

                                    <p>Using an accelerometer as a source of data, I designed and built analog signal conditioning circuitry to optimize the signal for digitization and serialization. After building ADC circuitry and Serialization Circuitry, I ran many diagnostic tests for baud rate and data loss with oscilloscopes to make sure I wasn't over sampling or undersampling. I used an RN-41 Bluetooth module. I used a microcontroller (Ardiuno) to program program protocols on the flash memory of the chip. On the recieving end of the connection, an FPGA (Nexys 5) was hooked up to the reciever. Using Xilinx , I implemented integration algorithms that I created. My solution for integration drift was numerous trials to calculate constants. At the end of the year, I presented this project at the annual TJStar Research Symposium (Large event where research projects are presented to the school community. In the image below is a block diagram of my circuit.</p>

                                    <p>I worked with 6800 series Motorola Microprocessor and learned microprocessor architecture. I also designed and programmed the processor in assembly for a specific function. Other components of this project include ROMs, Counters, Logic Gates. During Advanced Audio Electronics course, used previous microprocessor circuit for DSP. Later on, I also worked with a gate array for DSP. The image below is a schematic, I designed, of the original processor circuit w/o any additional components which I have later created to act as supplements for the original design.</p>

I then worked with PSpice and Circuit Lab to design a circuit that modulates multiple signals with one signal path and respectively demodulates them. Using configurations such as diode detectors, I developed AM modulation and demodulation circuits.</p>

I designed with up/down counters, decoders, and jfet transistors. I also used ROMs for my application and I had a rom for music storage. I developed with DACs for a source of audio.</p>

At first I was working with discrete circuitry, but then I started working with FPGAs and CPLDs for the DSP component of the circuit. I also studied discrete fourier transform during the course.</p>

                                    <p>I have three years of experience with Arduino IDE. I have worked with a diverse amount of Arduino boards and shields. Projects include robotic projects such as motor and servo control of an RC vehicle. I have used rf shields and I also have experience programming with the UART on the breakout boards. I used an Arduino to program bluetooth protocols (spread frequency hopping). I have developed many sensor based algorithms for sensors such as ultrasonic, flex, photoresistor, temperature and etc. Last but not least I have experience interfacing relays with microcontrollers. All of my circuit designs and schematics were done with Cadsoft Eagle.</p>
